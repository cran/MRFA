Description: Performs the MRFA approach proposed by Sung et al. (2020) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2019.1595630> to fit
    and predict nonlinear regression problems, particularly for large-scale and
    high-dimensional problems. The application includes deterministic or stochastic
    computer experiments, spatial datasets, and so on.
